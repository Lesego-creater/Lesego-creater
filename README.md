- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lesego-creator
- ðŸš€ Mechatronics | AI Enthusiast | Software Developer in the Making
I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. I love blending hardware and software to solve real-world problems and build cool projects.

ðŸ”­ What I'm Working On:
Exploring the intersection of mechatronics and AI, focusing on robotics, automation, and machine learning.
Learning and experimenting with microcontrollers like STM32 and embedded systems.
Building projects that combine my interests in mechanical systems, electronics, and software.

ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:
Deep learning for robotics and automation.
Advanced C/C++ and Python programming for embedded systems.
Enhancing my software architecture and development skills.

ðŸ’¡ Areas of Interest:
AI-driven automation
Machine learning algorithms
Embedded systems and robotics
Control systems

ðŸ¤– Fun Fact:
I enjoy tinkering with hardware just as much as coding! From building robots to developing AI models, I'm always up for a new challenge.
